Description: NSS module for using NIS+ as a naming service
 This package provides a Name Service Switch that allows your NIS+ server
 act as a name service. This means providing user account information,
 group id's, host information, aliases, netgroups, and basically anything
 else that you would normally get from /etc flat files.
 .
 This module was formerly part of glibc, but is now standalone to be able
 to link against TI-RPC for IPv6 support.
